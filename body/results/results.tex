\subsection{Adherence}
The usage logs were logging when the patient took his/her medication ie when did they push the button. Patients were told to take one pill in the morning, another in the afternoon and 2 at night. In order for us guage how adherent a patient is, we have chosen to count the number of times a patient made a 'mistake'. The mistake could be a patient not taking his or her morning pill. Or a mistake could be a patient taking 2 pills in the afternoon instead of 1. We want to establish if the audio treatment group performed better than the control group, in other words, are the number of errors made the audio group significantly less than the number of errors made by the control group? If so, then the we can conclude people are better of getting their prescription through audio in their local language.

All 8 patients made at least one mistake. A participant in the control group made only one mistake for the whole duration of the treatment process. The audio group made at least 10 more mistakes than the control group
